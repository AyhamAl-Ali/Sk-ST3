# Sk-ST3
A Modern, Colorful and creative Syntax Highlighting for Skript on ST3

Note: This Syntax Highlighting belongs to @HYPExMon5ter and I've only forked this because I liked to make my own version of this Resource.

```

Q: What will you provide in this Forked version?
A: I will be adding new syntax highlighting with my own colors.

Q: Are you going to continue with this?
A: Probably, I'm currently almost inactive due to my study and final exams that will begin in Jan 2019, so I will be updating this slowly till I finish my last couple exams and comeback again.

Q: Can we report issues and bugs or/and suggest new stuff on this resource?
A: Yes, you can use the issues section to report issues or/and suggest new syntax/colors.

Q: Why you made this?
A: I never liked coding without getting in the mood of coding, which requires some modern, [dark] themes and a nice syntax highlighting, I was lucky to find HYPExMon5ter's Syntax highlighting and I've used it for some time and then got a bit bored again.. so I decided to make my own forked version and learn the basics of Syntax Highlighting codes and Regex just so I can make this and use it.
