Q: What will you provide in this Forked version?
A: I will be adding new syntax highlighting with new colors.

Q: Are you going to continue with this?
A: Probably, I do a lot of coding with Skript Language so I will keep this resource active as I can and add new syntaxes to it.

Q: Can we report issues and bugs or/and suggest new stuff on this resource?
A: Yes, you can use the issues section to report issues or/and suggest new syntax/colors.

Q: Why you made this?
A: I never liked coding without getting in the mood of coding, which requires some modern, [dark] themes and a nice syntax highlighting, I was lucky to find HYPExMon5ter's Syntax highlighting and I've used it for some time and then got a bit bored again.. so I decided to make my own forked version and learn the basics of Syntax Highlighting codes and Regex just so I can make this and use it.
